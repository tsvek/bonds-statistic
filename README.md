# bonds-statistic


After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a small number of people, in addition to donating to the military, also began to actively buy government bonds. Banks and brokers have simplified this process to a single button, but without providing a convenient tool for portfolio analysis and visibility. 
Therefore, the idea for this project was to collect all the necessary information about bonds and visualise the most importent, interesting and necessary points.

In the final version, the Excel document contains the following pages:
1. information for all available bonds: number, coupon payment dates, maturity date, coupon amount (this is basic, but not final). Source: https://mof.gov.ua/uk/ovdp-shho-perebuvajut-v-obigu
2. current portfolio: you need to specify the number, price, quantity and date of purchase and the rest of the information will be filled in according to the entered data.
3. current portfolio but in USD (it is interesting to see the difference)
4. exchange rate
5. dashboard

TO DO LIST
 
- Change the input file to the English version (yes, it exists...)
- Add data to an existing document after processing the input file 
- Dashboard and visualisation
